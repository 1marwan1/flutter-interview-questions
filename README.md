 Flutter Questions and Answers
---

1.What is the difference between a `StatelessWidget` and a `StatefulWidget` in Flutter?

Stateless Widget
A stateless widget can not change their state during the runtime of an app which means it can not redraw its self while the app is running. Stateless widgets are immutable.

Stateful Widget
A stateful widget can redraw itself multiple times, while the app is running which means its state is mutable. For example, when a button is pressed, the state of the widget is changed

---

2.Explain the `Stateful Widget Lifecycle`?

The lifecycle has the following simplified steps:
createState()
mounted == true
initState()
didChangeDependencies()
build()
didUpdateWidget()
setState()
deactivate()
dispose()
mounted == false

3.What is Flutter `tree shaking` (flutter web)?

When compiling a Flutter web application, the JavaScript bundle is generated by the dart2js compiler. A release build has the highest level of optimization, which includes tree shaking your code.
Tree shaking is the process of eliminating dead code, by only including code that is guaranteed to be executed. This means that you do not need to worry about the size of your app’s included libraries because unused classes or functions are excluded from the compiled JavaScript bundle

4.What is a `Spacer` widget?

Spacer manages the empty space between the widgets with flex container. Evenly with the Rowand Column MainAxis alignment we can manage the space as well

5.What is the difference between `hot restart` and `hot reload`?


What is Hot Reload in Flutter:

Flutter hot reload features works with combination of Small r key on command prompt or Terminal. Hot reload feature quickly compile the newly added code in our file and sent the code to Dart Virtual Machine. After done updating the Code Dart Virtual Machine update the app UI with widgets. Hot Reload takes less time then Hot restart. There is also a draw back in Hot Reload, If you are using States in your application then Hot Reload preservers the States so they will not update on Hot Reload our set to their default values


What is Hot Restart in Flutter:

Hot restart is much different than hot reload. In Hot restart it destroys the preserves State value and set them to their default. So if you are using States value in your application then After every hot restart the developer gets fully compiled application and all the states will set to their defaults. The app widget tree is completely rebuilt with new typed code. Hot Restart takes much higher time than Hot reload

8.What is a `pubspec` file in Dart?

The pubspec file manages the assets and dependencies for a Flutter app.

---

9.How is Flutter native?

Flutter uses only the canvas of the native platform and draws the UI and all the components from scratch. All the UI elements look the same as native ones. This mainly reduces the burden of time for converting through some language to the native one and speeds up the UI rendering time. As a result, the UI performance is remarkably high

---

10.What is a `Navigator` and what are `Routes` in Flutter?

Navigation and routing are some of the core concepts of all mobile application, which allows the user to move between different pages. We know that every mobile application contains several screens for displaying different types of information. For example, an app can have a screen that contains various products. When the user taps on that product, immediately it will display detailed information about that product

---

11.What is a `PageRoute`?

Allow us to add animation transaction to the route

12.Explain `async`, `await` and `Future`?


Async means that this function is asynchronous and you might need to wait a bit to get its result.
Await literally means - wait here until this function is finished and you will get its return value.
Future is a type that ‘comes from the future’ and returns value from your asynchronous function. It can complete with success(.then) or with
an error(.catchError)

13.how can you update a listview dynamically?

By using setState to update the listview item source and rebuild the UI 

---

14.What is a `Stream`?

A stream is like a pipe, you put a value on the one end and if there’s a listener on the other end that listener will receive that value. A Stream can have multiple listeners and all of those listeners will receive the same value when it’s put in the pipeline. The way you put values on a stream is by using a StreamController

---

15.What are `keys` in Flutter and when should you use it?


You don't need to use Keys most of the time, the framework handles it for you and uses them internally to differentiate between widgets. There are a few cases where you may need to use them though.

A common case is if you need to differentiate between widgets by their keys, ObjectKey and ValueKey can be useful for defining how the widgets are differentiated



Another example is that if you have a child you want to access from a parent, you can make a GlobalKey in the parent and pass it to the child's constructor. Then you can do globalKey.state to get the child's state (say for example in a button press callback). Note that this shouldn't be used excessively as there are often better ways to get around it

16.What are `GlobalKeys`?

GlobalKeys have two uses: they allow widgets to change parents anywhere in your app without losing state, or they can be used to access information about another widget in a completely different part of the widget tree. An example of the first scenario might if you wanted to show the same widget on two different screens, but holding all the same state, you’d want to use a GlobalKey
